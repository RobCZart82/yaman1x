## Standalone upper ADC scan restart — candidate, 2026-11-07

The slow scan model can restart on AN4 after ADST has been cleared.
The new rising edge replaces the pending sample and deadline with the
original first-conversion delay of 266 cycles. AN4–AN7 commit to ADDRA–ADDRD,
preserving previous register values until each new conversion completes.
Subsequent deadlines remain 256 cycles apart. The model retains or clears
ADF according to the written bit. The reference is locked H8_ADC_3337
at MAME 706dbb73281320c54d7c2f16262c1c3786f2be01.

Independent tests check upper scan callbacks, register indices, control
bits and four exact deadlines across 1,035 time partitions, followed by
a restart into the lower bank. The existing lower scan and bus tests
also pass. Next, connect the 0x37 request to the bus callback and repeat
the local firmware diagnostics. Hardware, boot and audio acceptance remain open.

## Upper ADC scan request after ADST clear — merged in #240, 2026-11-07

Four read-only 1.04 probes on main c013f56 passed ADCSR=0x13 and reached
ADCSR=0x37 at PC 0x1B38. The synthetic zero-input runs stopped at cycle
127,793,965; the 1023-input runs stopped at 127,794,154. Each pair used
4,096- and 1,000,000-cycle slices and matched its cycle and PC. The
requested cap was 200 million cycles with 20 million callbacks.
The local ROM hash was unchanged and both VOP3 sample counters stayed zero.

The locked H8_ADC_3337 mode_update selects start channel 4 and end channel
7 for 0x37, with repeat and slow conversion timing. Its adcsr_w starts a
new conversion when ADST rises after the preceding 0x13 write. The current
bounded bus accepts only the lower scan and rejects this request. Next,
extend the explicit scan model to AN4–AN7 and verify the new start edge,
result-register mapping and deadlines against the original source.
Physical input calibration, firmware boot, MIDI and audio remain open.

## Clear ADST during the slow scan — merged in #239, 2026-11-07

Four traced read-only probes identified ADCSR value 0x13 at cycle
127,793,034, PC 0x1AAC. Each JSON matched its earlier uninstrumented
extended-run baseline byte for byte. The ROM hash was unchanged.

In locked MAME 706dbb73281320c54d7c2f16262c1c3786f2be01,
h8_adc_device::adcsr_w updates ADST and ADF but does not cancel an active
REPEAT mode on this write. timeout continues scheduling channel samples.
The bounded model now retains that deadline after 0x13, exposes ADST clear
and applies the original ADF write-zero behavior. A new start edge while
the scan remains active is a separate unsupported profile.

The bus test checks register readback, unchanged deadline, the following
sample callback and result lane over 1,035 time partitions. Both focused
ADC tests passed. Next, rerun the extended firmware diagnostic. Physical
ADC behavior, firmware boot, MIDI reception and audio remain open.

## Extended firmware ADC boundary — merged in #238, 2026-11-07

A temporary diagnostic checkout raised only the local requested cycle cap
to 200 million. The callback cap remained 20 million. Four read-only 1.04
swap16 probes used synthetic ADC values 0 and 1023 and slices of 4,096
and 1,000,000 cycles. All stopped at cycle 127,793,034, PC 0x1AAC, on a
byte write to ADCSR at 0xFFFFE8, with unsupported active ADC scan control.
The ROM hash was unchanged and VOP3 sample counters remained zero.

The earlier 100-million-cycle snapshots remain endpoint observations.
A first attempt to snapshot a failed bus hid the execution result behind
an observer error. Guarding the temporary observer on bus failure exposed
the boundary above. No failed-bus register snapshot is claimed. Next,
trace the requested ADCSR value and verify its original H8_ADC_3337
semantics at pinned MAME commit 706dbb73281320c54d7c2f16262c1c3786f2be01.
Firmware boot, MIDI readiness and audio remain open.

## Serial readiness at the cycle limit — merged in #237, 2026-11-07

On main 3e0dbeb, four read-only 1.04 probes repeated the synthetic low/high
ADC experiments with 4,096- and 1,000,000-cycle slices. All reached the
100-million-cycle limit. Side-effect-suppressed SCI snapshots at the end
matched across all four runs. SCI0 and SCI1 had SMR=00, BRR=0F, SCR=00
and SSR=84. SCR=00 leaves both transmit and receive disabled in the pinned
H8 SCI reference. This is an endpoint observation.

The same snapshots read TSTR=FF, channel 3 TCR=85 and ADCSR=B3. The
ADC scan is active with ADF latched. The local ROM hash was unchanged.
Both VOP3 sample counters remained zero. Next, trace control flow after
ADC setup toward serial initialization and compare readiness at later
bounded milestones. Firmware boot, MIDI reception and audio remain open.

## Firmware reaches the cycle limit with the ADC scan — merged in #236, 2026-11-06

Four read-only 1.04 swap16 diagnostics on main a0ba565 passed the 0x33
ADC start. The temporary idle-panel probe supplied either 0 or 1023 to
every ADC channel, with 4,096- and 1,000,000-cycle slices for each value.
All reached the requested 100-million-cycle limit without an access fault.
For each value, both slice sizes ended at the same PC and peripheral cycle.
The low profile ended at PC 0x3C736, cycle 100,000,001. The high profile
ended at PC 0x3C50E, cycle 100,000,002. These are synthetic inputs.

The trace showed AN0 sampled at 95,707,121, AN1 at 95,707,387 and the
remaining samples every 256 cycles in AN0–AN3 order, consistent with the
locked H8_ADC_3337 reference. The ROM hash was unchanged. Both VOP3 sample
counts stayed at zero. Next, identify the two end-of-run firmware paths
and which initialization or MIDI readiness milestones they have reached.
Firmware boot, physical ADC behavior and audio remain unverified.

## Slow ADC scan on the AN1x bus — merged in #235, 2026-11-06

An explicit scan callback supplies each AN0–AN3 sample at the machine
deadline. The 0x33 profile exposes aligned ADDR words and byte lanes,
preserves the prior AN3 result until its first scan commit, and updates
ADF at each completed sweep. Reset cancels pending scan events.

The bus test covers 1,035 time partitions with independent sample values,
lane expectations and exact deadlines. The pinned H8_ADC_3337 model below
defines the timing. A fresh firmware probe with explicit scan inputs is
the next step. Board calibration, boot and audio acceptance remain open.

## Standalone slow AN0–AN3 scan — merged in #234, 2026-11-06

The bounded 0x33 scan samples AN0 at start, commits after 266 cycles
and then commits each successive channel every 256 cycles. The caller
supplies a 10-bit sample for the next channel at each deadline. ADDR
words retain their last committed values. AN3 completion sets ADF and
wraps to AN0 while ADST stays set. ADF can be cleared independently.
This subset uses the locked H8_ADC_3337 reference below.

The independent test checks two sweeps across 2,059 time partitions,
including result packing, ADF timing, reset and invalid event rejection.
Next, integrate the scan into the bus and timeline with explicit sample
inputs. Firmware boot, physical ADC behavior and audio remain open.

## Firmware A/D scan request — merged in #233, 2026-11-06

All four read-only firmware probes wrote ADCSR 0x33 at 0xFFFFE8,
cycle 95,707,121, PC 0x1B84. Each traced diagnostic JSON was identical
to its earlier baseline. The probes covered synthetic AN3 values 0 and
1023 and 4,096- and 1,000,000-cycle slices. The local ROM hash was unchanged.

The locked original H8_ADC_3337 at MAME commit
`706dbb73281320c54d7c2f16262c1c3786f2be01` interprets 0x33 as a
software-started, repeating slow scan of AN0 through AN3 with ADIE clear.
It samples AN0 on start and commits after 266 cycles. Subsequent channels
commit every 256 cycles and the following channel is sampled at each commit.
The first ADF assertion is 1,034 cycles after start, when AN3 commits.
ADST remains set and the scan wraps to AN0. Each later sweep takes 1,024
cycles. These are original-model timings. Next, test this scan in isolation
with explicit synthetic values, then consider bus integration. Board analog
behavior, firmware boot, audio and REAPER acceptance remain open.

## Aligned ADDRD word read — merged in #232, 2026-11-06

The explicit AN3 profile now composes the aligned word at 0xFFFFE6 from
the two existing result bytes, in big-endian order. The locked original
H83002 map and ADC source define the byte lanes and 10-bit packing.
Tests check the value before and after conversion, the 24-bit alias,
alignment, nearby addresses, read-only behavior and idle-profile guards.

Four local read-only 1.04 probes with synthetic samples 0 and 1023 and
4,096- and 1,000,000-cycle slices passed the word read. All stopped at
cycle 95,707,121, PC 0x1B84, on a byte write to 0xFFFFE8 with unsupported
ADC control mode. The ROM hash was unchanged and both VOP3 sample counters
remained zero. Next, trace the new control value. Physical AN3 input,
firmware boot, audio and REAPER acceptance remain open.

## AN3 board input and ADDRD word boundary — merged in #231, 2026-11-06

Yamaha DM/DMS drawing 8811454 connects IC1 pin 83 (P73/AN3) to H8A15
through R22 (10 kΩ), with C20 (0.01 µF) from the input to DGA. This
identifies an RC-filtered address line. Its voltage at the actual sample
instant depends on bus history and remains unmeasured.

A temporary probe in a separate checkout supplied explicit 10-bit values
0 and 1023. For each value, the read-only 1.04 swap16 diagnostic ran with
4,096- and 1,000,000-cycle slices. All four runs sampled at cycle
95,706,795 and reached cycle 95,707,083, PC 0x1B6E. Each then stopped on
a 16-bit ADDRD read at 0xFFFFE6. The two sample values probe continuation
only. Both VOP3 sample counters remained zero, and the ROM hash was unchanged.

The original H83002 map at locked commit
`706dbb73281320c54d7c2f16262c1c3786f2be01` maps ADDR as eight bytes.
Its original `addr8_r` packs the two ADDRD bytes as result bits 15–6.
Next, test an aligned ADDRD word composed from those two lanes and rerun
the bounded diagnostic. Board voltage and timing, firmware boot, audio
and REAPER acceptance remain open.

## AN3 conversion on the machine timeline — merged in #230, 2026-11-06

A sink can supply a 10-bit AN3 sample through the optional
`adc_an3_sample(cycle)` callback. The bus samples on the ADCSR start
write at FFFFE8, schedules the pinned 266-cycle completion and exposes the
result at FFFFE6–FFFFE7. CPU deadline queries see that event. SCI and ITU
run before ADC on ties under project policy. Default sinks keep the idle
ADC profile. Other result channels, ADCR, word accesses and ADC IRQ stay
outside this profile.

Synthetic tests verify the callback cycle, result lanes, aliases, flag
clearing, reset, strict addresses and continuation over 268 bus and 321
CPU partitions. The original H8_ADC_3337 reference remains pinned below.
Next, trace the board AN3 input and choose an explicit diagnostic source
before running the local firmware again. Physical calibration, firmware
boot, audio and REAPER acceptance remain open.

## Standalone slow AN3 conversion — merged in #229, 2026-11-06

The standalone model accepts the observed single AN3 start with an explicit
10-bit sample. It commits the latched sample after 266 cycles, sets ADF,
clears ADST and exposes both ADDRD byte lanes. A repeated start while busy
does not sample again. ADF uses the original write-zero behavior. Reset
clears the result and cancels a pending conversion. IRQ enable, fast
conversion, scan and abort during a conversion are outside this profile.

The ROM-free test checks all 1,024 result values and 268 time partitions
against independently calculated byte values, status and deadlines. The
reference is the locked H8_ADC_3337 source documented below. The next step
is MMIO and machine-timeline integration with an explicit analog input.
Board analog values, firmware boot, audio and REAPER acceptance remain open.

## Firmware A/D start boundary — merged in #228, 2026-11-06

A temporary write trace in a separate checkout recorded ADCSR value 0x23
at 0xFFFFE8, cycle 95,706,795, PC 0x1B64. Both 4,096- and 1,000,000-cycle
slices produced the same write value, and each diagnostic JSON matched its
uninstrumented baseline byte for byte. The local 1.04 ROM was opened
read-only and its hash was unchanged.

The locked MAME commit `706dbb73281320c54d7c2f16262c1c3786f2be01`
maps ADDR bytes at FFFFE0–FFFFE7, ADCSR at FFFFE8 and ADCR at FFFFE9,
using H8_ADC_3337 with interrupt vector 60. The ADC source SHA-256 is
`68577b708cac2233a31c1dfa5a4e83162a0db295d6d92805002f29ad4334be19`.

In that source, 0x23 starts a software-triggered single conversion on
AN3 with the slow clock and the interrupt disabled. The conversion
samples at start, then after 266 CPU cycles commits the result to ADDRD,
sets ADF and clears ADST. The register exposes the 10-bit result in bits
15–6. ADCSR preserves ADF only when the old flag and the written bit are
both set. These are original-model semantics. Board analog values and
physical timing remain open. The next step is a bounded single-conversion
ADC test using explicit synthetic input and independently checked result
bytes, status and deadline. Firmware boot, audio and REAPER remain open.

## Idle panel byte diagnostic — merged in #227, 2026-11-06

Yamaha DM drawing 8811454 shows IC6's second decoder enabled by H8CS3,
with RD and A19 on its select inputs. At 0x680000 in H8 area 3, A19 is
high and a read asserts RD low. The decoder selects PNLCS from 2Y2.
PNLCS enables IC19, which buffers the pulled-up S1–S8 inputs onto D8–D15.
The even byte selects that upper lane. The pinned original MAME driver
at `706dbb73281320c54d7c2f16262c1c3786f2be01` only maps ROM and NVRAM,
so it supplies no panel read value.

The explicit idle panel experiment returns FF for the observed byte
read at 0x680000, representing all switches released. It preserves the
previous profiles' strict boundary and leaves writes, words and nearby
addresses unmapped. Synthetic CPU tests check the value, 24-bit alias,
access width, adjacent addresses and continuation across three slice sizes.

With the 1.04 swap16 ROM opened read-only, both 4,096- and 1,000,000-cycle
slices passed the panel read and stopped at cycle 95,706,795, PC 0x1B64,
on a byte write to 0xFFFFE8 (unsupported ADC conversion or IRQ enable).
Both VOP3 sample-pass counters stayed at zero. The ROM hash was unchanged.
Next, characterize the ADC request. Panel scanning, hardware timing,
firmware boot, audio and REAPER acceptance remain open.

## ITU input B without PKSCLK transitions — merged in #226, 2026-11-06

The AN1x research bus accepts the observed zero-based channel 3 input B
selection with automatic clear disabled. TSTR retains its start bit while
the channel has no internal deadline or clock ticks. The count and latched
flags remain accessible. Switching back to an internal clock resumes from
the TCR write cycle. The locked original MAME dispatch harness verifies
65,536 external-clock cases without input transitions. The bus test adds
65 time partitions covering the address alias, mixed channel progress,
flag retention, restart, restored internal deadline and reset.

The read-only 1.04 swap16 firmware diagnostic used the LCD/MEG/VOP3 level
experiment and 4,096- and 1,000,000-cycle slices. Both passed the earlier
FFFF60 write and stopped at cycle 92,381,680, PC 0xEA98, on an unmapped
byte read at 0x680000. Both recorded VOP3 register writes of 11,557 and 516
and zero VOP3 sample passes. The ROM hash was unchanged. The next step is
to identify the 0x680000 read from board and source evidence. PKSCLK
hardware timing, firmware boot, audio and REAPER acceptance remain open.

## PKSCLK board path — merged in #225, 2026-11-06

The Yamaha AN1x Service Manual DM/DMS drawing 8811454 routes PKSCLK
from H8 IC1 PA1/TCLKB and IC21 SK (pin 11) through L29 to DM CN6 pin 5.
KBS drawing 8811457 continues from KBS CN1 pin 5 to the HD63B05V0F PKS
IC1 CK/D5 pin 19. CL1 is a separate 8 MHz resonator on XTAL pins 24 and
25. These connections establish the signal path. Serial clock direction
and edge timing require separate evidence.

The locked original MAME driver at commit
`706dbb73281320c54d7c2f16262c1c3786f2be01` disables the PKS CPU and marks
its firmware undumped. Its 8 MHz setting describes the PKS CPU oscillator.
The next step is an explicitly bounded no-edge profile for channel 3 input
B, followed by the same two local boot slices. That diagnostic can show
what the H8 firmware does without PKS clock transitions. Physical clock
timing, PKS protocol, firmware boot and audio acceptance remain open.

## ITU external clock B reference — merged in #224, 2026-11-06

The [Hitachi HD6413002 hardware manual](https://www.renesas.com/en/document/mah/microcomputer-h83002-hd6413002-hardware-manual?r=1052021)
Figure 1-3 identifies FP-100A pin 96 as TCLKB/TEND1/TP1/PA1. The Yamaha AN1x
Service Manual identifies IC1 pin 96 as PA1. The DM/DMS circuit drawing
8811454 shows that pin on PKSCLK, with a 10 kΩ pull-up to +5D through R11.
The drawing identifies the signal path. Its transition timing remains open.

The dispatch harness ran 65,536 external-clock cases against unchanged
counter and scheduler methods from the locked original MAME source. With
internal time advancing and no external input, the reference cancels the old
internal deadline, preserves the count, flags and clock anchor, and emits no
interrupt. This is evidence for a bounded no-edge profile.

## Local firmware diagnostic after ITU IRQ integration — 2026-11-06

The #222 merge (32c5eee) passed all five main checks. Its local 1.04 probe used
the swap16 view and the LCD/MEG/VOP3 level experiment with a 100-million-cycle
limit and 20-million-callback limit. Both 4,096-cycle and 1,000,000-cycle slices
stopped at peripheral cycle 11,925,102, PC 0xB60, on a byte write to FFFF60.
The error is now Unsupported active ITU clock or clear mode. A temporary local
diagnostic reproduced both baseline JSON results byte for byte and identified
zero-based channel 3, clock selector 5 and clear selector 0. The locked H8H
TCR method maps that combination to external input B without automatic clear.
The local firmware hash was unchanged after the probes.

Both runs report no DSP sample passes and leave firmware boot and audio
acceptance open. Next, verify the pinned reference behavior and board evidence
for channel 3 external clock B before extending the bounded profile. The
reference counter and deadline methods skip internal scheduling for external
clock types. That behavior does not establish the physical input waveform.


## Active ITU interrupt delivery — candidate, 2026-11-06

Enabled ITU events now enter the shared bus timeline and CPU deadline query.
At a tie the existing SCI input and SCI events run first, followed by one ITU
timestamp in channel and compare/overflow order. This ordering is project
policy. The shared event limit counts each ITU timestamp once. Each vector
offers the existing DMA callback its absolute cycle before publication to the
H8 interrupt controller. A consumed event still latches the timer status.
Timer reset clears the timer state and the existing controller reset clears
pending interrupts.

Tests verify five vectors at exact cycles, polling flags, DMA consumption, event
budget exhaustion, and a synthetic CPU waking from SLEEP to execute the timer
handler across 221 split points. The pinned MAME dispatch harness remains the
counter and vector reference. This bounded internal-clock profile still needs a
fresh local firmware diagnostic and hardware acceptance.

Baseline #221 (aec0396) is merged and all five main checks passed.


## Active ITU polling profile — candidate, 2026-11-06

Byte accesses at FFFF60 expose TSTR with an E0 reset value and full written-byte
readback. The low five bits start and stop individual scheduler channels at the
current bus cycle. Internal clock and free/A/B-clear modes are supported with
interrupt enables clear. Starting with IRQ enabled, enabling IRQ while running,
and applying unsupported active clock/clear modes fail closed. Bus time advances
active counters and polling flags. Supported reset stops the timers and clears
their counters and flags.

Tests cover all 256 start masks, exact start/stop and wrap boundaries, compare
and overflow flags, active reconfiguration, reset, and 129 split CPU runs with
a synthetic TSTR write. The pinned source contract verifies original TSTR and
channel-enable methods. This is a bounded polling profile. CPU IRQ delivery
and the local firmware diagnostic at FFFF60 remain subsequent steps.

Baseline #220 (a6a8643) is merged and all five main checks passed.


## Stopped ITU counter MMIO — candidate, 2026-11-05

The bus now maps all five stopped TCNT words and their big-endian byte lanes to
the scheduler's counter state. Writes settle the scheduler at the current bus
cycle. Stopped counters retain their values as time advances and clear to zero
on supported peripheral reset. Odd word accesses reject before mutation.

The bus tests check all 327,680 TCNT word values across the five addresses,
both byte lanes, address aliases, channel isolation, reset and continuation
across 129 CPU slice splits. The existing TGR checks remain in place. The pinned
MAME contract verifies the original TCNT methods and the counter reference
checks 131,072 original update_counter comparisons. This step is bounded to
stopped channels. Timer start and CPU interrupt delivery are subsequent steps.

Baseline #219 (bf58ebc) is merged and all five main checks passed.


## Stopped ITU compare and interrupt registers — candidate, 2026-11-05

The stopped ITU scheduler now owns the values behind the ten TGR words and five
TIER/TSR pairs. Bus accesses retain their established address and width rules,
including big-endian byte writes to TGR, normalized reserved bits, and reset
values. Writes settle the stopped scheduler at the current bus cycle. TSTR,
active counter MMIO, and CPU interrupt delivery remain later integration steps.

Existing tests cover all 655,360 TGR word values and both byte lanes, all
TIER/TSR byte values at all five channels, reset, address aliases, invalid word
accesses, and split CPU execution. The pinned MAME source contract covers the
original TGR and TIER/TSR methods. This is a bounded source-compatible profile.
Baseline #218 (4e9c91f) is merged with all five main checks green.


## Stopped ITU TCR bus integration — candidate, 2026-11-05

Writes to the five byte-mapped TCR registers configure the corresponding stopped
scheduler channel at the current bus cycle when the locked source profile is
supported. All register encodings retain the existing bit-7-normalized readback.
Unsupported encodings expose no runnable profile. Cold and supported peripheral
reset reapply the internal free-running profile at the current epoch. TSTR,
active counter MMIO, and CPU interrupt delivery remain separate acceptance gates.

The bus test checks all 256 values at each of the five TCR addresses, including
24-bit aliases, channel isolation, reset, and the absence of events while stopped.
The existing CPU continuation checks and locked original TCR differential remain
in place. This is a bounded source-compatible profile. Hardware acceptance and
the firmware rerun at FFFF60 remain open.

Baseline #217 (d06b064) is merged with all five main checks green.
Candidate CI and automated review are pending.


## ITU TCR source-profile decoder — candidate,2026-11-05

Pure decode_itu_control maps96 supported internal-clock/no-external-clear TCR
values to divider,phase and free/A/B clear mode. All256 encodings are checked.
The locked H8H source compares raw count_type0..3 against enum DIV_2=6,
therefore phase stays zero even with edge-selection bits. This source behavior
is explicit and awaits hardware validation. Other encodings return empty.
Original unchanged tcr_update differential passes all256 encodings under
ASan/UBSan. Its exact method hash is pinned in the checker,whole-file identity
and archive lock verified. Counter integration probes cover all96 accepted
profiles. Bus/MMIO writes and CPU IRQ routing remain next acceptance gates.
Candidate134 CTest/103 Python. Own remote CI/review pending.
Merged baseline #216,189df0e,all five main checks PASS.


## Selectable per-channel ITU clear mode — candidate,2026-11-05

The shared scheduler now accepts independent free-running,A-clear and B-clear
channel modes through guarded settled-time writes. Default A-clear and the
existing0/1 source API are preserved. Mode switches settle the old configuration
and retain count,flags,enables and phase. Snapshot clear_index2 means free run.
Independent65536 free-running cases,2304 transitions,65 switch partitions and
an exact mixed-mode vector/time fixture PASS under targeted ASan/UBSan.
Original locked methods pass2048 mixed-channel streams,10240 single-channel
and131072 existing auto-clear value/flag cases. [Contract](h8-itu-clear-mode.md).
The candidate defines133 CTest/103 Python cases. Own CI/review pending.
Merged baseline:#215,2dfbc0eb73c2f20aa961684cff6e2b1c06bf2131,all five main
checks successful. Next supported TCR/MMIO decoding and CPU IRQ routing.


## Shared five-channel ITU scheduler — candidate,2026-11-05

H8ItuChannelScheduler merges five bounded channel owners by absolute deadline.
A shared edge consumes one budget unit with at most15 vector callbacks.
Equal timestamps use channel order then A/B/overflow as explicit project policy.
Callback time and scheduler epoch agree. Budget/callback/reentry failures stop
all future dispatch. Reconfiguration occurs at settled time.
33 split points,simultaneous vectors,stop/reconfigure and auto-clear recurrence
are checked independently. Locked original MAME methods pass2048 five-channel
stream comparisons plus10240 existing value/flag/vector/time comparisons under
ASan/UBSan. [Contract](h8-itu-channel-scheduler.md).
CPU IRQ delivery,mixed-mode MMIO and fresh firmware diagnostics remain next.
Remote CI and automatic review pending. Merged baseline is7b792ca (#214),with
all four applicable main checks successful. The candidate defines132 CTest
and103 Python cases. The previous reset-fix evidence below remains historical.

findings on source commit `95b7edb0feaa97be23d1105fe59b6f259596e640`; only PR-link
documentation changed afterwards (three files). No final-head review is claimed. The actual macOS runner is15; the required check retains its old name.

Bounded shared SYSCR modes, absolute machine time, supported subset reset,
LCD/MEG/native register-only VOP3 research adapters, and standalone ITU counter,
flags, deadlines and exact-time vector dispatch are implemented. The full
hardware RESET line and boot remain unaccepted. Next: selected active ITU
scheduler/MMIO integration and actual CPU IRQ delivery, then fresh local
firmware diagnostics at the documented FFFF60 timer-start boundary.
PKS/MIDI, DSP clock/table/EG fidelity, audio rendering, VST3/AU and REAPER
acceptance remain open. M0 is partial; M1 is prepared but unaccepted.

Merged fix: complete external research-sink cold reset through LCD
or MEG base references, with safe base ownership/destruction. Local regression
reproduced retained MEG/VOP3 state before the fix and passes after it. Own
Release build and 130/130 locally runnable CTest groups PASS (53.85s). Python:
102/103 PASS, one symlink case blocked by Windows privilege (WinError1314).
Source/notice audits and document links PASS. Local sanitizers not run; own
remote platform/UBSan/ASan/UBSan, MSan and MAME checks passed. No active engine
candidate is recorded. This documentation reconciliation changes no runtime code.
Machine subset reset still retains external chips; explicit sink cold reset
must be called with the machine stopped. No Yamaha data is needed.

## Historical preparation and closure records

The following dated candidate/pending statements preserve the original observations.
The current summary above supersedes their former active-task wording.

## Bounded ITU dispatch — candidate,2026-11-04

H8ItuBoundedDispatch owns one supported channel and emits exact-time A/B/overflow
vectors for channels0–4. Timestamp budget bounds work;simultaneous events use one
budget unit and at most three callbacks. Reentry,callback failure or exhausted
budget permanently stops the owner. Mutations occur only at its settled time.
Independent vector/time fixtures,129 split points,reconfiguration and fail-stop
controls;10240 original MAME dispatch/vector/time/count/flag comparisons PASS
under ASan/UBSan. Three unchanged methods extracted from the locked archive only
into a private temporary harness. CPU interrupt-controller delivery,MMIO start,
firmware boot and audio acceptance remain open. Next selected bus/CPU integration.
Own remote CI/review pending;candidate is separate from merged baseline.

Merged baseline:#211,f00587194b70ba3a7489da9a486f9ac6cba65ce2,130 CTest/103 Python;
all five PR and main checks PASS. Automatic review completed without findings
on3c2c51af1d89da2df5c98d5310383d826e212214;see development ledger evidence.
Older candidate sections below are historical records,not current open PRs.


## Pure ITU next-event deadline — candidate,2026-11-04

New next_itu_event computes the next enabled A/B/overflow event from supported
free-running/auto-clear snapshots without advancing or mutating state. Equal
edge distances combine event bits. Disabled/no reachable enabled event returns
empty;already latched status does not suppress recurring events. Absolute
phase/divider boundaries are used;unrepresentable future time throws without
mutation. Unsupported snapshot clock/cycle values reject. No IRQ dispatch,
CPU scheduler or MMIO integration added.
2048 independent tick searches plus pure/simultaneous/recurring/time-overflow
controls.131072 deadline comparisons with unchanged locked recalc_event PASS
under ASan/UBSan,explicit current time and no CPU callback delivery. Original
source only in private temporary harness. Next bounded dispatch and precise
vector/time/reconfiguration tests before bus start. No ROM/boot/audio acceptance.
Own remote CI/review pending.


## Internal-clock ITU auto-clear events — candidate,2026-11-04

New H8ItuAutoClear composes the existing counter/status for A/B-selected auto-
clear. Cycle is selected TGR+1 in32 bits;comparison target is wrapped16-bit
TGR+1. Tick distances capture A/B matches and overflow with IRQ disabled,
including starts beyond clear boundary and TGRFFFF. Mutations settle old time;
invalid configuration/index/time preserves state. No external clear/capture,
deadline,IRQ delivery or MMIO start. Existing free-running component unchanged.
1048576 independent initial/cycle/target tick cases,4128 A/B-source/phase/splits,
polling/reconfigure/FFFF/uint64 tests.131072 comparisons with locked unchanged
update_counter pass for values/flags,IER0;original source only in temporary
private harness. Initial fixture assumed immediate clear after lowering threshold
below current count;fixed to check continued count until full wrap,then explicit
counter rewrite for the immediate-clear test. No implementation workaround.
Next bounded deadlines/IRQ dispatch and selected MMIO integration;no firmware
boot or audio acceptance. Original MAME reference unchanged. Own CI/review pending.


## Free-running ITU counter events — candidate,2026-11-04

New H8ItuFreeRunning composes the monotonic counter and H8H latch for the
restricted cycle65536 internal-clock profile. Absolute tick-distance crossings
set compareA/B and overflow flags even when interrupts are disabled. TGRFFFF
compares at wrapped target0. Polling reads settle elapsed time;count/compare/
enable/status changes settle old state first. Invalid configuration/index/time
rejects without mutation. No IRQ callbacks,deadlines,auto-clear,capture or MMIO.
Independent per-tick oracle covers262144 initial/target cases;2064 divider/phase/
split cases,disabled polling/clear/reenable/stop and uint64 limits tested.
A locked unchanged original update_counter harness compares131072 free-running
value/flag cases with two TGRs and IER0. No original code saved in repository.
Counter exposes pure elapsed_ticks to share overflow-safe time conversion.
Next:auto-clear event semantics/boundaries if needed,then bounded deadlines and
IRQ dispatch before bus start. Firmware still stopsFFFF60;no boot/audio proof.
Own CI/review pending.


## Isolated H8H ITU status latch — candidate,2026-11-04

New H8ItuStatus explicitly latches compareA/compareB/overflow events independent
of enables. Read status/enables normalize reserved bitsF8;status write zero
clears and one preserves. pending() reports only flags&enables eligibility,
not interrupt-controller pending state or callback delivery. Reset clears low
flags/enables and exposes normalizedF8:component reset policy,not whole original
raw-register/hardware reset equivalence. Invalid event bits reject unchanged.
524288 independent event/enable/clear cases plus cumulative disabled-latch,
reenable/reset/invalid controls PASS. Another524288 comparisons use three
unchanged original H8H methods in a temporary ASan/UBSan harness. Original ISR
events are supplied explicitly;this does not prove counter compare detection,
polling-driven event generation,deadline or IRQ delivery. Next:counter-to-status
event detection with independent boundary/polling tests,then deadlines/dispatch
before MMIO start. No ROM,firmware or audio acceptance. Own CI/review pending.


## Isolated internal-clock ITU counter — candidate,2026-11-04

New H8ItuCounter owns monotonic absolute time,count,enable,divider/phase and
explicit cycle1..65536. It settles old time before enable/count/config changes;
invalid profile/time rejects without mutation. Disabled time does not accumulate
later catch-up. Internal shifts0..3,zero/half phase,wrap and starts beyond new
clear boundary supported. No flags,IRQ,deadlines,MMIO or firmware start enabled.
Independent per-tick oracle covers2097152 initial-count/profile cases;258 splits,
stop/restart/reconfigure,invalid retention and uint64 time extremes tested.
Tick quotient avoids now+phase overflow;counter arithmetic avoids count+delta
overflow. These large-time extensions are independently checked,not claimed
original-method comparisons at overflowing source arithmetic.
131072 value comparisons with the unchanged locked update_counter PASS under
ASan/UBSan in a temporary harness. TGR count0/IER0 deliberately excludes flag/
IRQ behavior;cycle and clock configured directly. Original source never copied
into repository. Next:compare/overflow flags and disabled-IRQ polling tests,
then bounded deadlines/dispatch before bus integration. No ROM/audio acceptance.
Own CI/review pending.


## Active ITU source contract — candidate,2026-11-04

Three locked original files/19 exact method identities checked through the
private verified archive snapshot. TSTR settles counters before enable changes;
compare flags may change with IRQ disabled;absolute divider/phase time,clear/
wrap boundaries,TGRFFFF u16 comparison and reset-after-children order require
independent tests. No active timer behavior enabled. Next:isolated monotonic
internal-clock counter,then flags/IRQ/deadlines,before MMIO/firmware acceptance.
[Contract and gates](an1x-active-itu-contract.md). Own CI/review pending.


## Firmware level-read experiment — candidate,2026-11-04

New explicit lcd-meg-vop3-level-experiment-16mhz profile configures the native
sink and host adapter for experimental_an1x_level;MEG zero stubs and upload
contract remain explicit. Older register-only profile still rejects22. No sample
advancement. Sink cold reconstruction preserves selected policy while clearing
state;subset reset retains levels. Synthetic CLI checks three slices,selected
read counters,old-profile rejection and invalid index;native sink verifies
-256=>C000,subset retention and policy-preserving cold reset.

Read-only unchanged1.04 ROM,swap16,100M cycles/20M callbacks,4096/1000000 slices:
identical stop at cycle11925102,PC2912(0xB60),data_writeFFFF60 byte,
Unmapped AN1x byte write. Native writes[11557,516],reads[448,0],samples[0,0];
MEG controls5/status_reads1,GPIO6316,TX/clock0. Completed-slice cycles
11923456/11000000,callbacks2000165/1839738 exclude the failed slice as designed.
ROM SHA4f72c8c595258ec9de83006287cc9b14f1450349a2253ebbf4d7437c22f95cbe
unchanged before/after. Both-chip callbacks do not prove full upload acceptance;
448 read callbacks do not alone prove scan ordering or the specialC000 branch.
No complete boot,MIDI or audio acceptance. The next blocker is the ITU TSTR
start path atFFFF60:active timer counter/flag/IRQ/time behavior needs original
reference and independent tests before enabling it. Do not treat the old
stopped-ITU storage profile as an active timer implementation.
Pinned original MAME/bridge unchanged. Own CI/review pending.


## Explicit experimental native level readback — candidate,2026-11-04

A shared Vop3LevelReadPolicy keeps default reject and separately names
experimental_an1x_level. Native owner chooses ABI profile1 once at construction;
invalid policy or configuration failure rejects/destructs safely. Host adapter
allows22 only with explicit policy and backend capability confirmation. Reg21
remains separate. No unknown read fallback,no clock advance or firmware profile
change. Default adapter rejects22 even on an experimental backend.
Independent integer oracle checks131072 signed-input/chip cases,all16 channels
on both chips,and496 invalid selected indices. Bad index poisons the adapter,
backend read counters remain unchanged. Strict configuration/mask/enum controls
and native configuration-failure destruction are tested. Existing timing tests
cover fractional evolution and target/aim discrepancy;physical conversion is
still experimental. Next:separately named bounded firmware experiment without
sample advancement,then distinct clock/upload/timing work. Original bridge and
pinned MAME reference unchanged;no ROM accessed or boot/audio acceptance.
Own remote CI/review pending.


## Reg22 readback contract — candidate,2026-11-04

Earlier firmware-consumer evidence is reconciled with the current strict native
stop. SELECT0..15,signed level and64 scaling are supported by prior analysis;
physical rounding/saturation/EG timing remain unverified. Historical installed-
DMS trace and current headless sink are distinct profiles. Snapshot PC54678
and historical bus-next-PC54676 are different observation fields,not proof of
instruction mismatch. Existing ABI2 profile1 is a labelled model experiment;
strict adapter22 remains rejected. Next:explicit opt-in read policy with native
profile selection and independent index/value tests,then separate firmware
experiment;sample advancement remains another gated step. No runtime change.
[Contract and evidence](vop3-readback-contract.md). Own CI/review pending.


## Native VOP3 firmware-probe profile — candidate,2026-11-03

New explicit lcd-meg-vop3-register-experiment-16mhz profile combines LCD16MHz,
original MEG zero-read stubs and experimental firmware upload control with the
native register-only dual VOP3 sink. Older profiles remain strict at VOP3.
JSON names the profile and reports per-chip writes/reads/sample_passes plus
audio_accepted=false;metrics availability is explicit (null counters if a native
handle failed),preserving the original execution-stop diagnosis;firmware_boot_accepted remains false. No DSP sample is
advanced;the model48kHz assumption is not silently applied to the CPU clock.
Synthetic CLI tests cover both chips,upload command,three slices,old-profile
rejection and unsupported read/byte faults,with unchanged input hashes.

Read-only local1.04 ROM (SHA2564f72c8c595258ec9de83006287cc9b14f1450349a2253ebbf4d7437c22f95cbe)
with swap16,100M cycles/20M callback cap and4096/1000000 slices yields identical
physical stop:cycle11260853,PC345720(0x54678),data_read440044 word,
error Unimplemented VOP3 register read. Native writes[10236,0],reads[0,0],
sample_passes[0,0],MEG controls5/status_reads1,GPIO6316,TX/clock0.
Completed-slice cycles11259904/11000000 and callbacks1886465/1839738 differ by
slice boundary as designed;they exclude work committed in the failed slice.
ROM SHA unchanged before/after. Counts show accepted core callbacks,not all
register semantics implemented or hardware-equivalent DSP program acceptance.
The next blocker is reg22 readback evidence/selected-index/timing semantics;
no zero fallback or undocumented ready response added. Existing bridge has an
experimental EG-readback path,but this profile deliberately keeps it disabled.
Pinned original MAME source lock unchanged;this is project integration,not new
original-method code. No boot,MIDI or audio acceptance. Own CI/review pending.


## VOP3 CPU word-bus integration — candidate,2026-11-03

Explicit optional sink hooks route only full-word data access in canonical
440000..4400FF and480000..4800FF windows after CPU24-bit normalization.
Byte/instruction accesses and sinks without opt-in stay strict. Odd addresses
and unsupported reads reject through the existing adapter. Pure wait query
uses external area2 only for selected VOP3 words;32 ASTCR/WCER/WCR combinations
are checked independently. No permissive MMIO fallback added.
An1xVop3ResearchSink composes LCD/MEG with privately owned native dual VOP3,
sharing the monotonic sink epoch and fail-stop policy. Upload status defaults
to reject;the pre-existing firmware-contract experiment requires explicit choice.
Subset bus reset retains external chips;explicit stopped-owner cold_reset
reconstructs both chips and the LCD/MEG epoch. No samples are advanced.
1024 independent coefficient/address/value cases,aliases,counters,read/width/
opt-in rejection,swallowed reentry,reset/rewind and129 synthetic CPU run cuts
check the integration. A MOV.W executed by CPU writes a verified BE coefficient.
No firmware CLI profile change,ROM access,boot/MIDI/audio acceptance or physical
clock/status proof. Existing pinned original MAME source lock is unchanged;
this step composes existing project adapters,not a new upstream-method port.
Next:explicit bounded firmware-probe profile with separate assumption labels.
Own remote CI/review pending.


## Native VOP3 register backend — candidate,2026-11-03

A noncopyable/nonmovable RAII owner connects the existing ABI2 bridge to the
standalone full-word host adapter. Both chips belong to one private handle;
no raw handle escapes. Internal bridge error -3 destroys the handle and later
calls fail closed. Invalid arguments/masks preserve native state. Construction
checks ABI2 and allocation. Backend must outlive its referencing host adapter.
1024 independent coefficient/address/value cases check fixed BE snapshot offsets,
exact write/read counters,strict read rejection,two-chip and owner isolation;
32 reconstruction epochs check fresh state and unrelated-owner preservation.
A separate fault-injected ABI fixture verifies ABI/allocation rejection,four
internal-error paths,exact destruction and no callbacks after failure. It does
not simulate a real DSP fault. No samples are advanced,so sample counters remain zero. No clock,CPU bus,
firmware boot,MIDI,table ROM or audio acceptance is added. Control status remains
only the explicitly selected firmware-contract experiment from #199.
The pinned original MAME reference in research/mame-source-lock.json is unchanged;
this integration reuses the existing project bridge,not a new original-MAME
method implementation or physical YSS236 proof. Next: explicit CPU word-bus/sink
routing and bounded firmware diagnostics. Local/remote validation recorded in
DEVELOPMENT_LOG; own PR CI and automatic review pending.

## Historical component evidence — current state is above

The following dated increments retain their preparation-time counts, open tasks
and pending-CI notes. They are not current blockers; completed later work is
summarized above and in the closure ledger.

### SCI MMIO/IRQ adapter — historical #39 increment

The [H83002 SCI MMIO/IRQ adapter](h83002-sci-mmio-irq.md), PR #39, connects both asynchronous channels to the standalone interrupt controller. Byte/word lane, DMA priority, debugger side effects, reset and isolation tests pass locally; the historical SCI-MMIO increment added one group. CPU scheduling and firmware integration remain open. See the dated entry in the [development plan](FIRST_REAPER_SOUND_PLAN.md).

## Observed and tested

- Standalone H8 digital ports, internal IRQ arbitration and IRQ register/pin
  adapters are tested. SCI now has one shared asynchronous TX/RX owner,
  integer-cycle scheduling, an SSR latch and compatibility facades. Synthetic
  byte/format, error, timing, partitioning and isolation tests pass. SCI MMIO and IRQ routing are implemented as a standalone adapter;
  Synthetic CPU/SCI integration is implemented; the full AN1x machine map/scheduler remains open.
- The eleven-patch MAME research target has a pinned source identity and a
  separate ROM-free macOS arm64 build/registration CI. This is distinct from
  local Yamaha-firmware execution and from the future embedded H8 port.

- Synthetic DSP serial loopback: interpreter/JIT equality, 4096 input samples.
- Two-chip native register replay agrees with independent Python reconstruction.
- LCD bus wiring and the separate MAME H8 research harness execute the unchanged
  local 1.04 firmware far enough to load both complete VOP3 programs, using an
  explicitly experimental upload-control status contract.
- A service-schematic-derived P92 input enables the DMS panel's detection;
  the firmware itself sets its RAM presence flag.
- The firmware's 0x22 reads are selected-channel signed levels, distinct from
  the VOP3 core's encoded 0x21 completion status. A 64x readback profile is
  experimental; rounding, saturation and physical level mapping are unverified.
- The integer sample clock and actual VOP3 execution agree across different
  call partitions; the synthetic timing probe runs 2400 samples per chip.
- The timed 5-second firmware trace now passes the live bridge audit: all 25,310
  bus events parse, and the loaded DSP state agrees with independent Python
  reconstruction. Each chip produced 28 complete 16-channel EG scans; all
  values were zero, so the separate channel-14 `0xC000` firmware comparison
  still fails under the experimental profile. That timed audit run sent no
  MIDI note and rendered no audio.
- The service manual pin table identifies H8 RXD0 as MIDI IN and RXD1 as
  keyboard data. An opt-in MAME patch wires its MIDI input image to SCI0/RXD0.
  A generated note-on/off MIDI file produced 21 RXD0 line transitions in a
  30-second MAME run with corrected byte-lane taps. SCI0 receive-data register reads remained zero;
  the only observed SCR write was `0x00` (receiver disabled). This confirms the
  serial pin route, not UART byte reception, firmware event handling or sound.

## Material limitations

- Direct, side-effect-suppressed SCI snapshots now independently observe both
  H8 serial devices. Paired 12-second passive and DSP-experiment runs first show
  SCI1 SCR=0x70 at six seconds, with 30 TDR writes and no RDR reads. SCI0 remains
  disabled at all recorded instants. This motivates PKS protocol research;
  a causal link to MIDI startup has not been established. See
  [serial-state observations](sci-state-milestone.md).

- The H8 harness remains register-only by default. A separate, opt-in research
  patch now advances both VOP3 models from MAME simulation time at the core's
  assumed 48 kHz rate before DSP MMIO. It compiled and ran against the local
  firmware for 1 and 5 MAME seconds, advancing both chips 48,799 and 240,799
  samples respectively. The 799-sample excess is MAME's frame-granularity
  overshoot; the AN1x clock remains unverified. This is not a complete boot.
- Upload acknowledgements, their latency and other status bits are experimental.
- Upstream `Vop3::run()` continues towards aim after crossing target, while its
  description says the segment stops at target. The synthetic reproduction
  gives 0x7FBF after 50 ms instead of the target's 0x2000. This is a
  code/description discrepancy; physical hardware behavior remains unverified.
- The library's 48 kHz model is not verification of the AN1x clock. Table-ROM
  index scaling, inter-chip audio, MEG effects and MIDI/PKS handling remain
  incomplete. A 128 KiB AN1x VOP3 mask-ROM image is present in the downloaded
  VOP3 research archive and its shipped-voice tables match the main firmware's
  table copy; this does not establish that both board ROMs match or verify
  address scaling; see [AN1x clock and table-ROM findings](an1x-clock-and-table-rom.md).
  The original PKS ROM is still unavailable in the checked
  sources.

Original downloaded inputs remain external. The vendored VOP3 header has one
reviewed, reversible first-decode initialization fix (#22); provenance records
both its original identity and the exact local edit. Other recorded upstream
files retain their locked contents. The EG target-hold discrepancy is unchanged.
Older reports in this repository are historical observations, not claims that
all device responses or the complete synthesizer are hardware validated.

## Repository validation

The ROM-free CMake/CTest suite also passes in GitHub Actions on Linux x64,
macOS Apple Silicon and Windows x64. These builds do not validate AN1x audio,
hardware timing or DAW/plugin-host behavior.

The merged #57 CMake suite has **39 CTest groups**, including the Python unittest
group, license coverage, provenance and normal/optimized ABI checks. The audit
of the earlier #37 baseline passed all 22 groups and 56 Python cases locally on macOS arm64;
the merged bridge-auditor regression fix adds four Python cases in the same CTest group.
That historical #39 increment contained 60 Python cases; current discovery has 84.
Default checks use no Yamaha data. Two upstream ROM-dependent tests remain
excluded, without substituting successful results for missing fixtures.

Fresh scope and evidence: [repository audit](REPOSITORY_AUDIT_2026-10-28.md).

## Current scheduling increment

The [bounded cycle dispatcher](cycle-dispatcher.md) provides monotonic, resumable event processing with explicit budgets and callback-failure handling. It is now combined with merged SCI integration PR #39. At this increment the historical Python count was 60; current counts are in the summary above. A two-channel SCI event owner is now implemented; CPU integration and hardware-validated tie ordering remain open.

## SCI event-owner increment

The [two-channel SCI cycle timeline](sci-cycle-timeline.md) combines immutable timestamped RX input and both UART clocks with explicit budgets. Whole/partitioned/resumed traces match for 256 dual-channel duplex patterns. Wire-before-clock and SCI0-before-SCI1 tie ordering is a software convention. CPU instruction/bus integration remains open.

## CPU host-boundary preparation

The [H8 host-services report](h8-host-services-boundary.md) records reviewed token references across 30 candidate sources and four verified generated outputs. Two independent regenerations match byte-for-byte. Word-address alignment and execution-budget carry are documented requirements for the future host adapter. This is source evidence, not compiler/linker closure; no new CPU execution is claimed. At #42, the historical suite contained 25 CTest groups and 68 Python cases.

## H8H bus-access increment

The [standalone bus helpers](h8h-bus-access.md) preserve two-cycle pre-access charging, separate instruction/data paths and aligned word access. Local comparison against five original pinned MAME method bodies: 200,000 mixed operations, zero differences. Native tests cover all 65,536 word values and failure/isolation contracts. At #43, the historical suite contained 26 CTest groups and 72 Python cases. No full CPU or Yamaha firmware execution is established.

## H8 execution-budget increment

The [execution budget](h8-execution-budget.md) isolates inter-slice debt and peripheral-deadline arithmetic. Original-method comparison: 200,000 synthetic no-event slices plus 200,000 deadline calculations, zero differences. Native bus/budget tests cover 1,000 partition histories and boundary/error/isolation cases. At #44, the historical suite contained 27 CTest groups and 74 Python cases. Actual full/partial opcode execution and complete CPU/peripheral scheduling remain open.

## H8 execution-order historical candidate — 2026-10-28

The [runner](h8-execution-runner.md) composes initial update, carry, peripheral catch-up and full/partial callbacks. A fail-stop callback bound detects nonprogress. Original-method comparison across 200,000 eventful synthetic slices has zero differences. Actual generated handlers, CPU state, IRQ entry and firmware/audio acceptance remain open; M0 stays partial.

## First generated H8 instructions — historical #47 candidate

The [limited execution profile](h8-first-instructions.md) executes real generated reset, NOP, MOV.B immediate and BRA rel8 handlers with owned CPU register/prefetch/substate storage. Other opcodes fail explicitly; IRQ/DMA/trace/retry/standby are disabled. Original H8H decoder/handlers and execute_run agree across 200,000 synthetic slices and 899,400 instruction reads, with a detected negative control. This is first opcode execution, not a complete CPU or firmware boot. M0 remains partial. Next: memory instructions, conditional branches, IRQ entry and CPU/SCI ordering.

## H8H byte memory and rel8 conditions — historical #48 candidate

The [expanded profile](h8-memory-branches.md) executes all rel8 conditions, MOV.L immediate32 and indirect byte loads/stores through full ER registers. Both generated selections are locked and retained with notices. Original-reference comparison: 200,000 mixed slices, zero differences in full state, instruction/data trace and memory. Word/long operations, arithmetic coverage, IRQ entry and real CPU/SCI scheduling remain open; M0 is partial and firmware/audio acceptance unchanged.

## H8H word/long memory — historical #49 candidate

The [word/long extension](h8-word-long-memory.md) adds MOV.W immediate, indirect word/long data accesses and the original 0100 prefix state. All 56 selected full/partial bodies match locked generated outputs. Original-code comparison: 200,000 slices, zero differences in diagnostic state, memory and ordered instruction/byte/word traces. Arithmetic coverage, IRQ entry and CPU/SCI integration remain open. The #48 automated review was still running at merge; it is not counted as completed evidence.

## H8H arithmetic and comparison — historical #50 candidate

The [arithmetic extension](h8-arithmetic-flags.md) executes selected ADD/SUB/CMP forms at 8/16/32 bits. A fixed-profile unsigned helper preserves H/N/Z/V/C, including half-carry at bits 4/12/28. Independent mathematical controls and original-code comparison agree, and CMP leaves registers unchanged. Register-wide/carry-input arithmetic, logical/shift operations, stack/IRQ and CPU/SCI integration remain open; M0 is partial and firmware/audio acceptance unchanged.

## Carry/register/logic — 2026-10-28 candidate

The [carry/register/logic extension](h8-carry-register-logic.md) retains 124 generated methods, adding sticky-Z carry byte arithmetic, wide register arithmetic, logic and immediate CCR storage. Over one million carry cases and 20,000 multi-byte programs agree with independent math; original-code comparison has zero differences across 200,000 slices. LDC stores I/CCR but does not implement IRQ input/entry. Wide register logic, shift/bit/stack and IRQ/SCI integration remain open.

## Wide register logic — historical #52 preparation snapshot

The [word/long register logic](h8-wide-register-logic.md) adds OR/XOR/AND and the original 01f0 prefix, with strict internal-state guards. 138 generated full/partial methods are retained. All 65536 extensions are checked; original-code comparison across 200000 slices has zero differences. M0 remains partial; shift/bit/stack/IRQ and CPU/SCI integration remain open.

## Single-bit shifts and rotates — historical #53 preparation snapshot

The [shift/rotate extension](h8-shift-rotate.md) adds all eight single-bit operations at byte/word/long width (186 retained generated methods). Independent bit-lane and signed-range controls, partial/debt and original-code comparisons pass. Two-bit forms, bit operations, stack/IRQ and CPU/SCI integration remain open; M0 is partial.

## Register bit operations — historical #54 preparation snapshot

The [register-bit extension](h8-register-bit-operations.md) retains 222 generated methods, adding byte register bit modification/test and carry boolean/load/store forms. Independent controls and 200000 original-code slices agree. Two-bit shifts are H8S/2000 forms, absent in the pinned H8H decoder, so they are excluded from this CPU profile. Memory bit forms, stack/control flow, IRQ and CPU/SCI integration remain open; M0 stays partial.

## Indirect memory bit operations — historical #55 preparation snapshot

The [indirect byte bit extension](h8-memory-bit-operations.md) retains 262 generated methods, original 7c/7d prefixes and 18 memory bit groups. Tests cover flags, addresses, rejected extensions, exact read/prefetch/write order, failures and partitioned execution. M0 remains partial; absolute forms, stack/control flow and IRQ/SCI integration remain open.

## Absolute memory bit operations — historical #56 preparation snapshot

The [absolute byte bit extension](h8-absolute-bit-operations.md) retains 302 generated methods, original 7e/7f prefixes and 18 abs8 bit groups. All short addresses, guarded extensions, flags and ordered bus effects are checked. M0 remains partial; stack/control flow and IRQ/SCI integration remain open.

## Stack and control flow — historical #57 preparation snapshot

The [stack/control extension](h8-stack-control-flow.md) completes the normal fixed-profile H8H instruction families: pre/post MOV at all widths, all JMP/JSR forms, BSR rel8/16, all rel16 branches and RTS. Synthetic RTE frame restore is implemented; IRQ/TRAPA entry is separate and unsupported. 366 generated methods retained. M0 remains partial; full CPU and CPU/SCI integration remain open.

#63 merged as dfa7af9bc21c8fe2b91367ad88b91bd7a56ba498 with five successful checks. #64 TRAPA is next, rebased onto main with the Windows flat-dispatch fix; #65/#66 remain dependent candidates. Earlier pending paragraphs are historical.

## External IRQ/NMI candidate

[Fixed reset-SYSCR entry](h8-external-irq.md) binds an optional controller to the CPU, preserving noirq prefetch boundaries and original entry/acknowledgement order. 438 selected methods; instruction counts remain 211/53/135. Dedicated ROM-free IRQ/NMI, stack-fault and partition checks plus 200000 original-method reference slices. Still a stacked candidate after #64; full CPU/peripheral scheduling and firmware/audio acceptance remain open.

## CPU/SCI receive composition candidate

[Interrupt-driven receive fixture](h8-sci-cpu-receive.md) tests both channels/all bytes and 1602 execution splits through RXI, CPU ISR, RAM storage, RDRF clear and RTE. No production machine bus or general timed MMIO write support is claimed. Follows #65; ROM boot and audio remain open.

## Bus cycle time candidate

#66 receive composition merged as 817e9ce91db22c770291fe2acf666f86f29e1896 with four successful CI checks. [Absolute bus completion timestamps](h8-bus-cycle-time.md) are the next candidate; optional host observation includes slice overrun/debt. CPU-driven UART writes still need explicit deadline rescheduling. No firmware/audio acceptance.

## CPU SCI TX candidate

[CPU-configured transmit](h8-sci-cpu-transmit.md), after #68: optional next_bus_event publishes newly created MMIO deadlines into both runner and handler boundaries. Synthetic BRR=0 TX checks both channels/all bytes and all 1602 split positions. Full firmware, concurrent I/O and audio remain open.

## CPU SCI duplex candidate

#69 merged as 298b8465aee4e74cfe7ec8e1459402b21f2ce9aa after all five CI jobs succeeded. [Overlapping TX/RX checks](h8-sci-cpu-duplex.md) cover all four channel pairings, independent wire/data/IRQ checks and 3604 execution splits. This is an integration-test increment; firmware boot/audio and receive-error matrices remain open.

## CPU framing-error candidate

#70 duplex tests merged as 860815eb62afb2d9b55e1e2cc8318a85967d4d04 with four successful checks. [ERI/FER and valid-frame recovery](h8-sci-cpu-framing.md) add CPU status capture/clear/RTE evidence and subsequent RXI reception. Fixed synthetic UART profile only; parity/overrun and firmware/audio remain open.

## CPU SCI parity candidate

#71 framing/recovery merged as 8e9c431f1a0629cc20db136c50c56eba81854202 with four successful checks. [Parity status/IRQ checks](h8-sci-cpu-parity.md) cover SMR0x20/0x30, good/bad input, CPU RXI/ERI acknowledgement and transmitted parity. Source-profile polarity is explicitly distinguished from physical hardware validation. Overrun, full CPU/firmware and audio remain open.

## CPU SCI overrun candidate

[Unread RDR and pending IRQ checks](h8-sci-cpu-overrun.md) verify ORER/RDRF and first-byte preservation across masked CPU time, then ERI and latched RXI service after unmasking. Synthetic fixed-profile evidence; depends on #72. Firmware/audio and combined-error/repeated-overrun coverage remain open.

## Absolute memory candidate

#73 overrun tests merged as 8446d10b65c698b5fbc749279f696d69c100e5fc with four successful checks. [Abs8 byte/abs16 byte-word MOV](h8-absolute-memory.md) adds six original groups (450 methods); encoding rows217 selected/47 missing/135 excluded. Abs32/displacements and full firmware/audio acceptance remain open.
